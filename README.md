## Car Insurance Claim Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a car insurance policyholder will file a claim. The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development and evaluation, model interpretation (using SHAP and LIME), and deployment via Power BI.

### Project Overview
Predicting car insurance claims helps insurance companies minimize risk, detect fraud, and make data-driven policy decisions. This project builds a predictive model using various supervised learning techniques.
